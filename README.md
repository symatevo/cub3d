# cub3d

First-person 3D representation of a maze using raycasting, similar to Wolfenstein 3D (1992).
Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map.

# How to run it
Using make will build the executable "./cub3D". To run it enter a map from "maps" folder.
For example you can simply run ./cub3d maps/1.cub
